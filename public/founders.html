                <h3>Pahal Raval <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pahal-raval-3347a221b/"><img src="images/linkedin1.png" alt="LinkedIn"></a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pariiii.444/"><img src="images/instagram.png" alt="Instagram"></a></h3>
                <h4> Founder </h4>
                <p> Pahal Raval, an Indian-American college sophomore and Cyber Scholar, is driven by a passion for addressing global challenges. During high school, she was actively involved in various clubs and was a key member of the varsity badminton team. Recognized six times on the Principal's List, Pahal also received the prestigious Presidential Award for her outstanding achievements. 

                    Facing misconceptions about her cultural identity, Pahal advocates for greater representation of South Asian communities worldwide. Her diverse interests led her to author a children's book available on Amazon Kindle and volunteer at her local religious center teaching languages and religious studies. She has also initiated her own YouTube channel and attended the FBI Teen Academy at their headquarters in 2022.
                    
                    Pahal is currently the Marketing Team Lead for hackUMBC, a major hackathon event, and serves as the Advocacy Director (Vice President) for UMBC's Asian American Student Union (AASU). She has attended the White House Forum for Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) month two consecutive years.
                    
                    Her frequent visits to Washington D.C. for business engagements have nurtured her sense of independence. She is also proud to be a Cyber Scholar with the Center for Women In Technology at the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC).
                    
                 Her encounters with inspiring figures in the AANHPI community such as Eric Nam, Lisa Ling, and Rupi Kaur have left a lasting impression on her journey.
                    
                 Her passion for travel and commitment to fostering inclusive communities at UMBC through her involvement in the Asian American Student Association board underline her dedication.
                    
                    Pahal's journey is marked by numerous achievements, each contributing to her mission through SAYI to create a space where children and teens from diverse backgrounds can connect and express themselves in unity.</p>
